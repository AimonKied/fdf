# FDF - Fil de Fer (42 Project)

## ðŸ§¾ Project Description

**FDF** is a graphical project from the 42 curriculum. The goal is to build a simple 3D wireframe renderer that projects a 3D terrain (based on height maps) into a 2D isometric view. It is written in C and uses the **MiniLibX** graphics library provided by 42.

The program reads `.fdf` files, which contain height values (Z-axis) for each point on a grid, and displays them as a connected wireframe model in a window.
